IML ASSIGNMENT 
Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

Here i have included the dataset in the program itself manually but we can also attach the .csv file that i have uploaded and use that as the dataset by modifying the code a little bit and importing the .csv file.
